Encapsulation - 
	when create a object of a class, related methods, properties, and members are treated as a single object (e.g. new object - all are kept in one class)

Inheritance -
	when inherit class, methods and properties from an existing/base class (e.g. when you create a shape, and Square inherited from Shape, it has the drawing method)

Polymorphism -
	when each class implements the same methods in different way (e.g. method overloading, method overriding)

Abstraction - 
	hide everything other than related data (e.g. use access modifier to hide or expose methods/properiies, laptop example)
